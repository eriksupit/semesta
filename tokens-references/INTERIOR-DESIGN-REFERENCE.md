## 5. RULES

- **Interior design style name = gestalt anchor** — model trained on millions of design magazine articles, recognises style name before material tokens
- **Style name goes in `production_design_style` child** — not as standalone field
- **Material tokens follow style name** — format: `[Style Name]: [material token 1], [material token 2], ...`
- **BANNED for Semesta Digital:** maximalist (too luxury), Hollywood Regency (wrong register), Art Deco (wrong era), Moroccan/Bohemian (wrong geography)
- **BANNED material tokens in `scene` field:** geographic labels (`Jakarta kitchen`, `traditional Indonesian`), ethnic labels (`Javanese decor`), motif labels (`batik pattern wall`)
- **Always pair** interior design style with film production designer — double anchor

## 6. BRANDED FURNITURE TOKENS (consistency lock-anchors — reusable in ANY room)

*Added 2026-06-22 (GATE 0-ENV, validated on E01 Kamar master). Rationale: a named manufacturer product + exact finish gives the t2i model a strong single prior → it reproduces the SAME object across derivative angles, suppressing "creative" drift. Use the **exact product name + exact finish wording** below; do not paraphrase the finish (paraphrase = weaker prior = drift). Source = IKEA product pages (Priority 1).*

**Rule:** pick ONE named product per furniture slot, name it inside `subject_anchor` (primary_subject or a supporting_objects sub-slot). Keep the finish verbatim so every room sharing that piece renders the same wood tone. International brand register per `09-environment-sheet/00-README-ENV.md §2.5` (IKEA = lower-middle / middle-class home tier).

| Slot | Token (verbatim) | Finish prior | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| Double bed | `IKEA MALM bed frame high headboard, white stained oak veneer` | pale oak veneer | ✅ ikea.com |
| Nightstand | `IKEA MALM 2-drawer chest, white stained oak veneer` (used as nightstand; matches MALM bed) | pale oak veneer | ✅ ikea.com |
| Wooden chair | `IKEA INGOLF chair, solid wood antique stain, slatted backrest` | brown stained wood | ✅ ikea.com |
| Wardrobe | `IKEA PAX wardrobe, oak-effect doors` | warmer oak effect | ⚠️ variant name not fetched — confirm exact PAX door (e.g. FORSAND/REPVÅG oak-effect) before deep reuse |
| Sheer curtains | `IKEA LILL net curtains, white` | sheer white net | ✅ ikea.com |
| Oriental rug | `IKEA PERSISK HAMADAN rug, low pile, handmade oriental wool` | red-tone handwoven persian | ✅ ikea.com |
| Bedding | (material token) `matte cotton bedding muted slate-grey` | — | not yet branded — brand later if needed (e.g. DVALA/ÄNGSLILJA grey) |
| Living-room sofa | `IKEA EKTORP two-seat sofa, beige linen-blend slipcover` | beige slipcovered | ✅ E02 master (2026-06-23) |
| Open shelf | `IKEA KALLAX shelving unit, a 2x2 open square cube grid, white-stained oak effect` | iconic countable cube grid | ✅ E02 master (2026-06-23) |
| TV bench | `IKEA BESTÅ TV bench, white-stained oak-effect, a low closed flat-door media cabinet` | low flat-door media cabinet | ✅ E02 master (2026-06-23) |
| Desk | `IKEA MICKE desk oak-effect` (+ `a simple black swivel office chair`) | oak-effect work desk | ✅ E02 master (2026-06-23) |

**Verifiability caveat (validated E02, 2026-06-23):** a weak-silhouette named product (e.g. `IKEA LACK TV bench`, or a vaguely-described `low open shelf`) lets the t2i model improvise the form — `LACK TV bench` rendered as ambiguous cubes until swapped to `BESTÅ` (flat-door cabinet), and a generic shelf rendered as a plain cabinet until pinned to `KALLAX 2x2 cube grid`. Pick named products whose silhouette is **iconic and countable** (KALLAX cubes) or **unmistakable** (BESTÅ flat-door) so consistency across angles is measurable, not just asserted. Also keep distinct silhouettes per piece in one room (KALLAX cubes vs BESTÅ flat-door) so two units never blur together.

**Wood-tone caveat (validated E01):** MALM (pale white-stained oak) + PAX (warmer oak-effect) + INGOLF (brown) render as three distinct tones in one room — this is realistic mixed-furniture, not a defect. When reusing, keep the SAME three tokens so the spread reproduces consistently rather than randomly.
